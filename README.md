# 20alse.ssis.nu

This repository backs up my personal school website, https://20alse.ssis.nu, which will be shut down
after I have graduated. It not only preserves all the pages on the original routes that were used to access them,
it also handles CI/CD to automatically build, install and push applications.

**The repository you're currently viewing acts as a "parent repository" containing submodule links to other repositories
that starts with `20alse.` and are used for structuring the different projects that are backed up.** Some deviations from this naming convention
exist and that is because some repositories already existed on GitHub before I started bacing up things that didn't.

## About building and publishing web projects

### Installing
This repository contains submodules according to the structure above. Make sure to check them out to get all subpages!

### Deta

This website is designed to run on [Deta](https://deta.space), however, it is really a very generic build process.
By simply running the script `prepare-and-run-handyman.sh` (tested on Debian and Ubuntu), a build environment containing the following will be created:
* Python 3 and pip (latest available versions)
* Node.js and NPM (20.\<latest available subversion>)
* Ruby and Bundler

not only that, the script will also run `handyman.py` to create a `dist` directory based on the mapping in the `ROUTES` file
and the scripts inside the `scripts/` directory (read on for more information about that).

#### Pushing to Deta and updating submodules

On Windows, running `.\push_to_deta.bat` will update submmodules and push the whole code to Deta.

### Handyman, the builder ðŸ”¨

Since I am such a creative guy (smiley face), there is a bunch of toolsets, dependencies and other stuff
that every application depends on. To create a streamlined interface, I have created building scripts for each repository.
They can be found in the `scripts` folder. These building scripts produce a folder named `.build` which is then uploaded
via my custom Python script. Routing is done in the ROUTES file.

#### How to handyman

##### How Handyman works
1. Check out the repository you want to add in `src` or add it manually.
2. If it does not need any build scripts, do not add anything in the `scripts/` folder.
Otherwise. create a script with `.sh` ending (Bash) and add the build scripts that you need to execute.
3. Edit `ROUTES.md` to control where the built dist (outputted to a `.{repo/folder name}-build` directory *relative to the working directory*) ends up in the `dist`.
4. Run the `handyman.py` script to generate output.

##### Ignoring files

You can add a `.handymanignore`-file in any directory in `src`. Here is its format:

```
# Comment, will be ignored
(dir) path_to_directory/
(file) file.extension
```
